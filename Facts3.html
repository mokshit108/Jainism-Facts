        <li>Jainism stresses on the importance of controlling the senses including the mind, as they can drag one far away from true nature of the soul.</li>
        <li>Limit possessions and lead a pure life that is useful to yourself and others. Owning an object by itself is not possessiveness; however attachment to an object is.Non-possessiveness is the balancing of needs and desires while staying detached from our possessions.</li>
       <li> Enjoy the company of the holy and better qualified, be merciful to those afflicted souls and tolerate the perversely inclined.</li>
        <li>It is important not to waste human life in evil ways. Rather, strive to rise on the ladder of spiritual evolution.</li>
        <li>The goal of Jainism is liberation of the soul from the negative effects of unenlightened thoughts, speech and action. This goal is achieved through clearance of karmic obstructions by following the triple gems of Jainism.</li>
        <li>Jains mainly worship idols of Jinas, Arihants and Tirthankars, who have conquered the inner passions and attained divine consciousness. Jainism acknowledges the existence of powerful heavenly souls (Yaksha and Yakshini) that look after the well beings of Thirthankarars. Usually, they are found in pair around the idols of Jinas as male (yaksha) and female (yakshini) guardian deities. Even though they have supernatural powers, they are also wandering through the cycles of births and deaths just like most other souls.</li>
        <li>Every soul is the architect of its own life, here or hereafter.</li>
