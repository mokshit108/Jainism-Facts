    <center><img class="factsimg"src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1e/Be-a-Jain-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid1858934-v4-728px-Be-a-Jain-Step-3-Version-2.jpg.webp"></center>
        <ul >
           <li>In Jainism all life has a soul, from bacteria to plants, to animals and to humans. Because they all have souls they all have the ability to reach nirvana.</li>
           <li>Jains do not worship a god or saint, and instead work to attain nirvana as they believe other liberated souls have attained.</li> 
           <li>In Jainism the belief is that karma is actually matter that attaches to the soul as a result of thoughts, actions, and words, regardless of whether they are positive or negative.</li>
           <li>In Jainism there is the belief that there are multiple universes. This is Bharat Kshetra, one of three universes that we may be reborn into.</li>
           
           <li>In Jainism the swastika holds different meaning than what most associate it with (Nazis). The four sections each represent one of the four states of existence (hellish beings, plants/animals, heavenly beings, humans). From birth until death humans can pass through these temporary states of being.</li>
           <li>Jains are vegetarians due to their non-violent beliefs. They may also become vegan to avoid the damage and destruction of modern farming.</li>
           <li>The goal of Jainism is liberation of the soul from the negative effects of unenlightened thoughts, speech and action. This goal is achieved through clearance of karmic obstructions by following the triple gems of Jainism.</li>
